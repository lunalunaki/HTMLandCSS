<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<p>Most of the stuff on the web is no different than the stuff on your computer — it’s just a whole load of files sorted into a whole load of directories.</p>
<p>HTML files are nothing more than simple text files, so to start writing in HTML, you need nothing more than a simple text editor.</p>

	<h3>Lesson 1</h3>
<h4>Open Notepad++ which is installed on your computer. On the menu bar go to Language>H>HTML. This will format the document as an HTML file </h4>
<h4>Type this in to your text editor:</h4>

<pre><code>This is my first web page</code></pre>

<h5>Now create a folder called “html” wherever you like to save files on your computer and save the file as “myfirstpage.html”.</h4>
<div class="note">
<p>Be careful. It is important that the extension “.html” is specified - some text editors, such as Notepad, will automatically save it as “.txt” otherwise.</p>
<p>You also need to ensure that your file is being saved as plain text. </p>
</div>
<h5>To look at HTML files, they don’t even need to be on the web. Open a web browser such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari or Internet Explorer and in the address bar, where you usually type web addresses, type in the location of the file you just saved (for example, “c:\html\myfirstpage.html”) and hit return. Alternatively, go to the File menu of the browser, select Open, and browse for the file.</h5>
<h5>Pow. There it is. Your first web page. How exciting. And all it took was a few typed words</h5>
<div class="note">
<p>I’ve said here to use a basic text-editor, such as Notepad++, but you may be tempted to use a dedicated software program such as Adobe Dreamweaver. This program will never give you the same control over a web page as coding by hand.</p>
<p>If you do decide to use specialized code-editing software, I recommend one in which you are still coding by hand. They can, in fact, be helpful, especially the more advanced you become, in terms of code syntax highlighting and file management.</p>
